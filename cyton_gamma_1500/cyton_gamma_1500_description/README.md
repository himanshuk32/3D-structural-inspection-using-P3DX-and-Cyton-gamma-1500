# cyton_gamma_1500_description
URDF file for the Cyton Gamma 1500 incl. meshes and rviz files

A package for cyton_gamma_pkg which you can find in my repos as a larger part of the cyton_gamma_300-1500_operation_and_simulation package, which can be used to operate, plan, and execute the robot in simulation and hardware.
